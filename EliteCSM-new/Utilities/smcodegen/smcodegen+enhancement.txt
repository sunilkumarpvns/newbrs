Here in this mail I mentioned the few tiny issues, when access the elitecodegen tool for Access Group module.


(1)     In DataManager folder data class name is not properly generated (currently it will take the modulename) also interface is not generated at this place. (fixed)

(2)     In Hibernate folder xml file is generated  withouth .hbm.xml extension,in this xml file we get wrong class name in <class> tag,(currently it will take  (fixed)

The modulename in place of the dataclass name)

(3)     In Hibernate folder we have HDataManager class which implements the datamanager; here we are getting the wrong name. (fixed)

(4)     Location of the datamanger must inside the module, currently it is in the submodule. (fixed)

(5)     In web folder every time the the viewstaffaction class and in forms folder viewstaffform file is generated. (fixed)

(6)     In action class don’t necessary to mention the whole the jsp path, take one forward variable and initialize it with the struts-config forward name value.(fixed)

(Currently mentioned the full jsp page path)

(7)     It is not necessary to generate the two forms for the same jsp e.g. for create Staff we are mentioned the two action class initCreateAction and Create Action (it`s flxible.. we can add and remove action)

But only the one CreateStaffForm file.(in elitecodegen module for every action different form name mentioned)  (Right now not supported)

(8)     In struts-config file action name must be initSmall.(currently initcap). (fixed)

(9)     In config folder change the hibern.xml file with the name of hibernate.cfg.xml file,also in this file  <mapping resource /> tag  currently getting the hbm file with the (fixed)

Modulename, also in this file using \ in place of the /. (fixed)

sub module name should rename to parent moudule name. (fixed)
 
genrate populate method code like beantoForm and fromtoBean (fixed)
 
 .hbm file name should be based on table name  (fixed)
 
 action class name form name action prefix all are table name based (fixed)
 
 Location of hibernate.cfg.xml file should be src/config/*.cfg (not src/com/config) (fixed)
 
 In jsp file there should be a space between new keyword & name of the form. (Himanshu) 
 
 In action class catching block exception should be pre-commented (Himanshu)
