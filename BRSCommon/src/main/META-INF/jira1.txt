  create scrum  board along with   project

  create version


 create sprints

 create issue ()

project backlog meetings -------------------> decide ,  10-20    members(actually required to be create story)
(product  owner (i will give priority for issues) ,

change manager(budget ,integeration of all teams with all technologies),

scrum master ,bussiness analasist ,subject matter experts(SME))



scrum master will conduct 
 sprint plaing  meeting( 1.30  to  2hrs  mettings,
for every 15 days they will conduct metting)--->15 days for each sprint  (developers)
(expect product owner , change manager)


(involving -->Subject experts,all developers(they don't any issue ) )

subject master experts will explian about the requirements  to  all developers


after explanation scrum master will asking about estimation to all the developers.

estimation is nothing but story points.



 Note:- in Agile Every Developer has an independency of taking stories ,
 scrum master will act as a co-oridinator .

 he is not assing really story.



 start sprint:-
 ===============




note:-  after completing the sprint ,sprint showcase metting,(developers will give demo
   on about implentation  to product owner ,change owner.)

if product owner is not  satisfying with  developer implemetation logic ,he is asking 
to change the logic, that will include in next sprint as a stroy.


  when ever if want to hold the stroy due some other reason then we can move to backlog.
  if it is  required to complete then we can move to next sprint.


    
 
  note:-
===========

Daily --> scrum metting  --> max 15 min for metting


three questions  -->  1) what you have done yestrday 
                      2)what are you doing today
                      3) what are impediment( i,e problems ) 
  


  note:-  worklog information is adding by developer as a comment.
    that is showing to all.


  attachements-->flow charts, unit test plan ,unit testing result etc....



 components:- the stroy is releatd which  component like jsp,html components , then we can create 
             components.

Epic -> is nothing high level grouping of components,(high level story)

  (logically related strories with respect to functionality )


    

story -->

   --> in a stroy -->we can create story points

   -->in a story --> we can create task and sub task.



  

reports:-- to calculate velocity.

velocity -->how many no of story points can be develiered by team in a sprint is called 
velocity.



-->scrum  --->  like  daily 


-->scrum master--> he is a person co-ordinating  backlog mettings,sprint planning mettings,
daiy scrum meeting.



waterfal model:-  during performance testing of the application  ,it is fails  due
to arch /desg issue then will not have be having enough time to accomidate changes.


agile:-  it is nothing but small waterfall model.
